[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Provisdom/spectomic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Provisdom/spectomic)

Generate Datomic or Datascript schema from your Clojure(script) specs.

## Installation

[](dependency)
```clojure
[provisdom/spectomic "0.6.0"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

## Usage

Let's take a look at a basic example.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.spec :as s]
         '[provisdom.spectomic.core :as spectomic])
=> nil

(s/def ::string string?)
=> :boot.user/string

(spectomic/datomic-schema [::string])
=> [{:db/ident       :boot.user/string
     :db/valueType   :db.type/string
     :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}]
```

In this example we define the spec `::string` and then pass it to `datomic-schema` which 
returns a collection of schema matching the data our `::string` spec represents. Now 
let's look at a more complicated example.

```clojure
(s/def :entity/id uuid?)
=> :entity/id

(s/def :user/name string?)
=> :user/name

(s/def :user/favorite-foods (s/coll-of string?))
=> :user/favorite-foods

(s/def :order/name string?)
=> :order/name

(s/def :user/order (s/keys :req [:entity/id :order/name]))
=> :user/orders

(s/def :user/orders (s/coll-of :user/order))
=> :user/orders

(s/def ::user (s/keys :req [:entity/id :user/name :user/favorite-foods :user/orders]))
=> :boot.user/user

(spectomic/datomic-schema [[:entity/id {:db/unique :db.unique/identity
                                        :db/index  true}]
                           :user/name
                           :user/favorite-foods])
=> [{:db/ident       :entity/id
     :db/valueType   :db.type/uuid
     :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
     :db/unique      :db.unique/identity
     :db/index       true}
    {:db/ident       :user/name
     :db/valueType   :db.type/string
     :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}
    {:db/ident       :user/favorite-foods
     :db/valueType   :db.type/string
     :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/many}
    {:db/ident       :user/orders
     :db/valueType   :db.type/ref
     :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/many}]
```

In this example we have a `::user` entity that is uniquely identified by an `:entity/id`. The
user also has a collection of his or her favorite foods `:user/favorite-foods` and a collection
of orders `:user/orders`. 

We need to let `datomic-schema` know that `:entity/id` is unique. We do this be providing `datomic-schema`
with a tuple instead of just the spec keyword. The first element of the tuple is the spec and the second
element is any extra schema fields to be added to the attribute. In this case we attach `:db/unique` and
`:db/index`. You can see in the outputted schema that `:entity/id` does indeed have those extra fields.

`:user/name` is not particularly interesting as it is similar to our basic example.

`:user/favorite-foods` is represented as a collection of strings in our example. And as you can see in the 
returned schema, `:user/favorite-foods` is `:db.cardinality/many` and `:db.type/string`.

`:user/orders` is a collection of maps of the for dictated by the spec `::orders`. And our returned schema
is of type `:db.type/ref` and `:db.cardinality/many`.

### Resolving Custom Types
Your code may use types that are not resolvable to Datomic types with the default type type resolver 
implementation. One option to this problem is to use the schema entry format you saw above with `:entity/id`.
If you recall, we set the `:db/unique` property for `:entity/id` to `:db.unique/identity`. You can actually
manually set the `:db/valueType` too. This could, however, become very repetitive. 

The second option is to pass a map with the `:custom-type-resolver` key set to a function that returns a
Datomic type. If the default type resolver cannot resolve an object's type, your function will be called
with the object passed to it as the only argument. Your function is expected to return a valid Datomic 
type, as defined [here](http://docs.datomic.com/schema.html#required-schema-attributes).

## Usage in Production

This library provides two functions for generating schema from specs: `datomic-schema` and `datascript-schema`.
Both function calls occur at **runtime**. This means that if you include this library as a runtime dependency,
test.check will also be included. Often you don't want test.check as a runtime dependency so it is suggested that you
include this dependency as `test` scope (e.g. `[provisdom/spectomic "x.x.x" :scope "test"]`). Including this library 
with `test` scope means that all your calls need to happen at compile time or elsewhere. Here are two examples of how
this library can be used at compile time.

### Macro

It is convenient to store the list of specs you want to convert into schema as a var. By doing so you are able to easily
add new specs to the schema list at any time. We will use a `def`'ed var as an example. 

```clojure
(def schema-specs [[:entity/id {:db/unique :db.unique/identity :db/index true}] :user/name :user/favorite-foods])
```

Now let's write a `def`-like macro that will generate our schema at compile time:

```clojure
(defmacro defschema
  [name]
  `(def ~name (spectomic/datomic-schema schema-specs)))

(defschema my-schema)
```

Now our schema is statically compiled and available in the var `my-schema`.

### Build time

Sometimes you may want to save your schema into an actual EDN file for use in multiple places. This can be easily
accomplished with a Boot task.

```clojure
(require '[provisdom.spectomic.core :as spectomic])

(deftask generate-schema
  [s sym VAL sym "This symbol will be resolved and have its content passed to `datomic-schema`."]
  (spit "my-schema.edn" (spectomic/datomic-schema @(resolve sym))))
```

This task is simple but does not adhere to Boot's design patterns. Here's a slightly more complex example that integrates
well with other tasks.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])

(deftask generate-schema
  [s sym VAL sym "This symbol will be resolved and have its content passed to `datomic-schema`."
   o out-file VAL str "Name of the file for the schema to be outputted to. Defaults to schema.edn"]
  (let [specs-var (resolve sym)]
    (assert specs-var "The symbol provided cannot be resolved.")
    (with-pre-wrap fileset
      (let [out-file-name (or out-file "schema.edn")
            out-dir (tmp-dir!)
            out-file (io/file out-dir out-file-name)]
        (spit out-file (spectomic/datomic-schema @specs-var))
        (commit! (add-resource fileset out-dir))))))
```

## Caveats

### Misleading Generators

When writing your specs you need to be mindful of the generator that is used for the spec. One misleading
predicate generator is `float?`. `float?`'s generator actually uses the same generator as `double?`, meaning
it does not return a number with type `java.lang.Float`. This is problematic for our schema generator as it
relies on your objects having the correct type that they represent. This is not a bug in Clojure spec however.
If you look at how `float?` is defined you will see that `float?` returns true if the object is a `java.lang.Double`
or a `java.lang.Float`. To combat this we can write our own `::float` spec like this:

```clojure
(s/def ::float
  (s/with-gen
    #(instance? java.lang.Float %)
    #(gen/fmap float
               (s/gen (s/double-in :min Float/MIN_VALUE :max Float/MAX_VALUE :infinite? false :NaN? false)))))
```

### Rare Edge Cases

If you write a Spec that uses a generator that will return values of a different type very rarely then you
will run into schema generation problems. Make sure your generators are returning consistent types.

## Implementation

Rather than parsing every Spec form, we chose to implement this library using generators. Every Spec that is
passed to `datomic-schema` or `datascript-schema` is sampled 100 times using test.check. The type of each 
sample is then matched with a Datomic type. Next we make sure that each sample is of the same type. If your
generator is returning multiple types for a Spec then it's not clear how the schema should be generated so
an error is thrown. If the type is a collection then we need to verify that for each sample, every element 
in the collection is of the same type. If that is true then we return a map with `:db.cardinality/many` and
the `:db/valueType` set to the type of object the collection contains.
